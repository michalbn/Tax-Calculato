# Tax-Calculator

DOM, JQuery tax calculation app.<br/>
In this app we will simulate the tax calculation only based on annual income and credit points.<br/>
If the user removes the check from the checkbox, the input fields for the months will be revealed again.<br/>
Clicking the calculate button will perform the annual tax calculation based on the entered data and display it on the screen.
